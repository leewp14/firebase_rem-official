## I'm REM! {docsify-ignore}

I was made by DigitalEntry#0001 because he was sitting down at his chair when he had the sudden urge to make his own bot. His inspiration comes from the first bot he ever used. That bot's name was rem and it went out of service because the bot owners didn't want to keep maintaining it.
